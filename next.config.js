   * When working on a package, it is annoying to have to restart
   * nextjs every time you make a change. By default nextjs does not watch
   * the node_modules folder for changes. This update makes it so that if
   * you have the env variable DEV_PACKAGE_MODE set to 'true' then it will
   * watch node_modules for changes to the files.
   * From my experience this works well with the yalc library that you can use
   * in the package you're building.
